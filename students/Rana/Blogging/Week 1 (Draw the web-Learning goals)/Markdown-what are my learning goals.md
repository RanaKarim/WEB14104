## What are my learning goals ##

At the moment I feel that I am highly limited to what I can create and do due to my lack of knowledge and technical abilities. I know how to make basic websites using CMS such as WordPress and how to then go into the CSS and slightly change the aesthetics such as the colour scheme and text font/size. I do not feel confident in independently creating, managing and hosting my own websites. I really think these are key skills I will need in the future as I aspire to be a web designer / developer and I feel that I should know as a web media student.

This unit I would like to:

- **Develop my coding skills in HTML and CSS**
- **understand what is and how to use PHP**
- **Understand Web hosting and effectively be able to independently host my own websites**
- **understand how to use FTP clients and be able to independently manage content on my own websites using them**

 As you can see this unit I really want to grow and expand my technical abilities and knowledge in order to develop myself as a student and as an aspiring creative professional. I would like to have experience in the field and get a real feel for working in the industry. However if I currently had a placement in a digital agency I feel that I wouldn’t have much to offer and be able to do much due to my current skill set/level and knowledge. I would really like to change that.

A lot of information and tutorials that concern my personal goals can be found on [Lynda.com.](http://www.lynda.com/Web-training-tutorials/88-0.html?bnr=NMHP_blocks) Also a website called [W3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/) can almost act as a coding dictionary for HTML, CSS as well as JavaScript which I am also very interested in. W3schools also provides tutorials. I feel the best way I learn is by watching and then doing myself. Video tutorials are very helpful to me. However I feel that I also learn quite effectively with live tutorials. For example Matteo’s session on web comics was really great. He would show us then we would then try and experiment ourselves. The HTML and CSS we use that day was all really new to me but the way the session was orchestrated allowed me learn efficiently while enjoying myself. Having more sessions like this in this unit would be great.

I am quite proud of what I was able to achieve with my final web comic on [code pen](http://codepen.io/rana18/pen/xbGavY). After I had learnt from the session I decided to make a new one from scratch to hand in for assessment. I wanted to experiment with what I had learnt and customize it in my own way.

I remember having problems with this but through experimenting with the code I solved the problems I ran into and by the end of t I had a greater understanding of how things work. I think that by having more projects would encourage me to practice and develop my skills. Also I think I should spend more time looking up and watching tutorials on Lynda to develop my technical understanding and skills.
