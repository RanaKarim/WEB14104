The see the web as something that we the users not only take and read from, but constantly grow and expand. I felt the best way to show this was through a flourishing tree sprouting out of the earth. The leafs on the tree representing web content and the tree itself represents initial stricture as well as connections and links and the arrow tip is was to show how its ever expanding. The earth was used to show how it is globally accessible.

I see us as prosumers, meaning we consume and produce content. Everything we post online from pictures, videos, music, documents all add to and expand the web. The various people around the tree should help represent this.

The person with the spy glass is looking and reading content, were as the person with the watering can is helping the tree grow by giving and writing content. The two people on near the top are shining sun rays from a laptop and mobile phone showing how we can also produce and consume web content from various digital devices.
