**Name:** [Wimbledonpartyshop.com](http://wimbledonpartyshop.com/)

**About:** 

Wimbledon party shop is a local business to me that sells party or event clothing,  accessories and equipment.

**My comments:**

I feel this website is not very welcoming. It is very static and feels quite dead and empty. Interactivity is very minimal. I highly dislike the aesthetics and overall look and feel of the website from color scheme to layout, I don't think it looks very professional. 

Other then providing information about the store such as opening hours, location and contact details I don't find the website useful. The thing I find really annoying is that even the product information/details is no more useful then gallery. They are just photos, no prices, descriptions or reviews are on their website, it just tells you call in and ask which keeps me asking myself the relevance of the website or is it even finished?

Other then a lack of information the categorizing system on the products is very poor and armature as well as not being able to buy products from the website either, it has no e-commerce values. Again very annoying , if i wanted something I would have to make a trip to the store.

**About:**

**My comments:**

I think this website is full of useful content but trying to read and find what you are looking for may be quite difficult. the website seem very static, the layout is quite difficult to read and understand it all looks quite cluttered I think their is far too much grouped text. This is in contribution with the color scheme which is quite bland, more colors should be involved to help differentiate the information. I also felt that the navigation bar at the top could be more utilized.  

The information or website content isn't the most exciting, after all it is a council information website however they way it was presented did bore me and didn't allow me to have a pleasurable experience.

**About:** 

Noodle fondle is local Japaneses restaurant.

**My comments:**

I also feel that this website is very empty, dead, static and unwelcoming. Their is hardly any interactivity. In my opinion the aesthetics are nothing special either. It looks like the website has been made in two minutes with a photo collage and red background. I think it looks very amateur. Using the website is very dis-pleasurable. The website only allows you to view a menu via PDF file or provide you with contact details and location.

To order food you need to call the restaurant up, their is no online menu or orders so you cant make purchases from the website. Other then the phone number and location which can already be seen on the browser, I don't think this website has any real relevance.
