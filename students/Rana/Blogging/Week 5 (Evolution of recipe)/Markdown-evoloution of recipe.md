## Evolution of my recipe ##

**Step 1**

First I purely on the content of the recipe when writing my HTML. Using headings, lists and paragraph tags I entered in my content. Check out the [HTML file](https://github.com/RanaKarim/WEB14104/blob/master/students/Rana/recipe/victoria%20sponge%20recipe%20V1-V3/HTML%20traditional%20victoria%20sponge%20cake%20recipe.html).


**Step 2**

Using CSS I applied some Google fonts to the text and added some background colour. Check out the [CSS file](https://github.com/RanaKarim/WEB14104/blob/master/students/Rana/recipe/victoria%20sponge%20recipe%20V1-V3/CSS%20style%20sheet%20Traditional%20victoria%20sponge%20cake%20recipe.css).

**Step 3**

I then pasted my HTML content into [ Grid lover](http://www.gridlover.net/app/). Grid lover helps you adjust sizing and spacing of text to make it more readable. The changes or settings are generated into CSS which you can copy back into your style sheet. Check out the [Grid lover CSS file](https://github.com/RanaKarim/WEB14104/blob/master/students/Rana/recipe/victoria%20sponge%20recipe%20V1-V3/CSS%20Grid%20lover%20style%20sheet%20traditional%20victoria%20sponge%20cake%20recipe.css).

**Step 4**

Then we were introduced to the Skeleton CSS Boilerplate which lets you structure your content into rows and columns. I applied rows and columns to my recipe and linked in the [Skeleton CSS file](https://github.com/RanaKarim/WEB14104/blob/master/students/Rana/recipe/victoria%20sponge%20skeleton-recipe/css/skeleton.css) which has the styling for the amount of columns you choose. Check out my skeleton recipe [HTML](https://github.com/RanaKarim/WEB14104/blob/master/students/Rana/recipe/victoria%20sponge%20skeleton-recipe/index%20recipe.html) & [CSS](https://github.com/RanaKarim/WEB14104/blob/master/students/Rana/recipe/victoria%20sponge%20skeleton-recipe/css/recipe.css) files.
