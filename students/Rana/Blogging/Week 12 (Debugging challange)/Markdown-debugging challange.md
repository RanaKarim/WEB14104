## Debugging Challange ##

**Tools and techniques I used:**
 

- The console within inspect elements. I found this really helpful because sometimes it will help you identify the exact problem and what line the issue is occurring within your code. 

- I would also try and do some research on the issues online because someone else may be having the same issues and could potentially have a solution.  A source that we found helpful was a forum for coding queries called stack overflow. 

- Breakpoints within inspect elements. I found using break points quite effective it really lets you break down the code (functions) and accurately see what parts are working line by line if you wish.

**What I learnt:**

During the debugging challenge I learnt that you need to be persistent and not give up. Debugging can be a very time consuming process depending on the complexity of the issue and often solving one problem can lead onto another.

Some it was like almost like a comprehension. We were making changes and inserting bits into the JavaScript but some of the answers were already in the HTML like the name of of the functions or variables. You should also check your grammatical errors and pay attention to higher and lower case characters. 

**My attempt:**

Check out my debbuging challenge on [codepen](http://codepen.io/rana18/pen/LVVevP?editors=101). By comparing it to the [original version  ](http://codepen.io/baddeo/pen/YXPpwV?editors=001) you can see what bits of code I adjusted and inserted into the editor.
