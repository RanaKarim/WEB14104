## Formative assessment feedback ##

During my formative presentation A website called [Noodle Foodle](http://www.noodlefoodle.co.uk/). 

Aesthetically I felt it looked quite amateur, pre-dated as well as having a lack of content on the website.It really only shows a telephone number and a address which I can see when I search on browser making me think the website is irrelevant. The website had an external PDF menu which is very static and I felt could be created and and be dynamic on their website so that if the owners wanted to make any changes they can do it much more efficiently.

After showing my [digital wire frames from inVision](https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/console/2997962/66517998/preview) The feedback I got was that:

- They were ready to taken HTML and CSS.
- The basket may confuse people because their not sure if they have items in it already and I should find a clearer way to show if its empty and what are recommended dishes because they can be mistaken for items in your basket.
- The menu could have images for every food item
 
The changes I will make are to the basket, I can see why it can be confusing and will think of ways of simplifying it for the users. However I am choosing not to add an image for every food item. Allot of the dishes are similar just in different portion size and meat or ingredients used. I prefer to just have the food item and information about it like [Wasbai's food menu page](https://www.wasabi.uk.com/food/467) (inspiration as seen on mood board)

I will update my action plan on [Trello ]([https://trello.com/b/luHj7zUL/bad-website-improvements](https://trello.com/b/luHj7zUL/bad-website-improvements)). The next steps are applying my design to and experimenting with HTML and CSS.
