## My learning outcomes ##


**My initial learning goals**

Reflecting back on my initial [learning goals](https://github.com/RanaKarim/WEB14104/blob/master/students/Rana/Blogging/Week%201%20(Draw%20the%20web-Learning%20goals)/Markdown-what%20are%20my%20learning%20goals.md) I wanted to:

- 	Be more confident with HTML and CSS
- 	Understand how to use PHP
- 	Understand how to host my own websites
- 	Understand how to use FTP clients like FileZilla

**What have I learnt?**

HTML & CSS

- Greater understanding of the tools to use when writing code, I mainly used sublime text. It helps me write code more fluently as it acknowledges or predicts the tags you want and closes it for you. The colour code also helps you break it up and differentiate what language you are writing in.

- Organizing and structuring my code more appropriately. I’ve learnt to break up my code and structure it in ways to be easily read and understood.

- Using Skelton style sheet package. This allowed me to break my page into rows and columns which I found really useful to structure my page the way I wanted to make it more readable and look more professional.
 
- Greater understanding of the make of an element such as the core content, padding, border and margin. By using CSS I understand how to customize these values and utilize them more effectively.

- Animations and transitions. Using CSS I learnt how to apply transitions on elements so that they can transform or change when the user interacts with them. Using web kits I can also apply animations to elements when the user interacts with them.

**Using PHP**

- Greater understanding of what php is used for. I understand how php can be used to make web pages dynamic and allow people or clients not web developer’s change or adjust the content on the web pages through a content management system like WordPress. 

- A greater understanding of the loop. I understand how php can split the page into sections such as header, content and footer and how they loaded onto every page e.g. if I wanted something a like a logo to be on every page in the header section of the page I would put in in the body of the header file. 

- Advanced custom fields and tempting. I know how to use advanced custom fields alongside repeater fields to break up and provide more accurate sections for clients or users to fill in content on the pages on the CMS. I also know how to then show these custom fields on the templates I can create within my code. I then know how to apply these templates onto the pages I create in WordPress. 

**Hosting websites and FTP**

- **Local hosting:** Using the WAMP server I know how to structure my folders correctly within the root folder to create or separate projects I am working on or developing. I also know how to install WordPress locally for these projects and connect it to databases that I learned to create in MYSQL.

- **Remote hosting:** I also have greater understanding of using my gird host domain. I can install WordPress on that server and run projects online.
 
- **Greater understanding of FileZilla:** Using FileZilla I know how to connect to and target remote sites from my grid host domain and upload files to them.
 
- **Moving Local to remote:** Using FileZilla I know how to upload files and themes I’ve been working on locally and other content like plugging to my remote sights. I also know how to use a plug in called wp-sync-db to migrate the databases from the local projects and push them to my remote one. 

**Problems I encountered:**

**WAMP server 404/WordPress:**

When I first installed WAMP and started to develop locally I was having problems creating or accessing the new pages I created on WordPress, I would always get a 404 error.  I googled this problem and found a solution on a [WordPress forum page](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/using-wamp-new-pages-get-404-requested-url-not-found-on-this-server) that solved my problem.

**Migrating the database:**

I had a difficult time trying to deploy local website. I had a recurring problem when trying to migrate the database. This error “rename table `_mig wp_commentmeta` to `wp_commentmeta`” kept popping up. At first I tried to search for the answer on google. I found a forum page with someone saying they were encountering a problem but the solution provided didn’t make much sense and wasn’t really helpful. I then tried to push my local site to a different server other than my grid host. This worked to an extent. However my FTP was having problems connecting to that server so I was struggling to copy files over such as my bower components and skeleton style sheets. Allot of the time the server would cut out and I would be disconnected. After contacting support for that server l learnt my machine was being blocked for an unexpected reason. The solution round this would be unblock some IP addresses. In the meantime I tried pushing my database back to my own grid host and it worked perfectly so no further actions were required.

**What could I improve in my project?**

On my website I have created a mock up basket, account pages and log in section from static HTML and CSS. If I had more time for the project I would like to implicate a fully functional account and e-commerce system. 

I wanted to allow users to log into my website view their account details and view information like their payment/delivery details, previous orders and dishes that they can favourite. I also wanted them to be able to view a menu and add items to a basket and then go through a checkout process that allows them to order/pay online and then have it delivered to them. I did research a few e-commerce plugins but they seemed quite confusing to customize and apply to my website. I know next year we will be doing an e-commerce that may provide me the skills to create a website like this.

I also wanted a dynamic scrolling header image on my menu pages like my wireframes, I guess I could have made a dynamic header image using custom fields but I wasn’t sure how I could make it a slider.

**What do I intend to improve in my personal and professional skills?**

**Development**

I feel much more confident with portraying my ideas aesthetically using coding languages such as HTML and CSS however I really want to have a greater understanding and focus on functionality and being able take what I design and develop it into something fully functional. When designing my wireframes I was worried about a basket and checkout system but was told to not focus on functionality and create a good design based on a user’s perspective which is great for the design stages but in the end I wasn’t really able to create what I designed.

**Time management**

I did create an action plan on Trello, which helped me clearly broke my tasks down for me and helped my easily understand what I had to do. However I admit to letting it sit there sometimes and it got quite intense and stressful. To help me progress through my project I also created a daily checklist of tasks I wanted to complete on top of the Trello which had everything. I found this helped even if I didn’t manage to get every daily task done but I should have implanted this earlier which would have caused less stress and given me more time to polish over my work.
