<p>This is the traditional recipe for a Victoria sponge cake, a much loved English favourite.</p>
<h2>Main ingrediants</h2>
<ul>
	<li>3 egge</li>
	<li>150g self raising flour</li>
	<li>150g caster sugar</li>
	<li>150g butter or margarine</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon vanialla extract</li>
	<li>strawberry jam</li>
</ul>
<h2>Buttercream ingrediants </h2>
<ul>
	<li>100g icing sugar</li>
	<li>50g butter</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Preheat the oven to 170 C / Gas 3. Place the shelf in the centre of the oven. Grease and line two 18cm (7 in) sandwich tins with baking parchment.</li>
	<li>Weigh the three eggs. Note the weight and measure the same amount of sugar, flour and butter.</li>
	<li>Sieve the flour into a bowl and add the sugar, butter or margarine and vanilla. Crack in the eggs and beat well with a wooden spoon or mixer, until the mixture is light coloured and fluffy. Divide the cake mixture between the tins and smooth the tops.</li>
	<li>Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 5 minutes in the tins, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
	<li>To make the buttercream, sieve the sugar into a bowl, add the butter and vanilla and beat well.</li>
	<li>To sandwich the cakes together: Add a layer of jam to the top of one of the sponges, followed by a layer of cream on top of the jam, finish by placing the last of the sponges on top. Dust with a layer of icing sugar if desired.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Extra tips</h2>
<P> Use margarine, butter is quite heavy. Eggs can vary a lot in size, for perfect results weigh the 3 eggs. This will more than likely weigh over or under 150g (6 oz). For example, if the eggs weigh 175g you would use 175g each of the flour, sugar and margarine.</P>
