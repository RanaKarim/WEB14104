----------
Within my shorter review I explained that I felt this website wasn't the best due to its **lack of**:

 - interactivity
 - Content 
 - Function
 - Aesthetic design

----------
**Invisibility of system status**

As I have said before there isn't much that goes on within this website. However I wouldn't say the system status is completely invisible. When you click one of the two options provided such as **menu** or **contact** a blue outline appears around them letting the user know they have clicked it an that the next page is loading. 

**Mismatch between system and the real world**

The website does use and follow real world convention such language that I as a user was able to understand. 

**Punish mistakes**

There isn't really a situation where this may happen on this particular website because the functionality is so limited. However when you click the **menu** option a PDF document opens up. The website doesn't actually provide a back or exit option. You have to do this though your browser.

**Inconsistency**

There are very view web pages to this website but it is quite consistent, the same text font , size and color have been used on the pages as well as the banner and color scheme . 

**Error induction**

There are no error inductions on this website because there is no need for them. However if there was an online payment section it would be a problem not to have them.

**Recall rather than recognition**

When you are on the **contact** page the website **doesn't** tell you, you can only know by reading the content of the page. Also when you move from the **home** page there is no way to return other then to go out and then back into the website through your browser.

**Mystery Meat Navigation**

Mystery meat navigation is not used on the website, All the clickable links are presented in very understandable text format.

**Inflexibility and inefficiency of use** 

As I have repeatedly said that this website doesn't have much functionality or **actions**. However In terms of inflexibility and inefficiency of use the website only caters for one type of user and does note record or learn from user activity.

**Pointless information**

This website has a very minimal amount of information but I wouldn't say any of it is irrelevant. All the information on the website is useful.

**Lack of help and documentation**

The steps the user has to make to get from point A to Point B and find what they are looking for is very simple but there is **no** help , documentation or guides provided.

**Visual inaccessibility**

There isn't much information on this website but the content is readable. Text is quite large and white that lets it stand  out clearly from the red background.

**Content updatedness**

I think this is a major concern for this website, It is static and is not being updated which i think makes it very unwelcoming because it feels dead and empty. 

**S-tone of voice**

There is hardly any text but it all sounds like the **same** tone of voice and **is** consistent within the web pages.

**Loading time**

The images used on the website are quite large. I think the developer or designer just done this to fill the web pages. However this doesn't effect the loading speed. I think this is due to the lack of content and functionality, other then small amounts of text and images there isn't much content, resources or processes to load up.
